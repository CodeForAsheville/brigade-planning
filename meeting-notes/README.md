## Notes from the 8/2/2016 meeting

1. We will have a re-entry book working session in September, tentatively 9/10 from 11am - 2pm, venue TBD. Eric will be responsible for prep for the session & will consult with likely participants re: date/time.
2. We will begin planning a hackathon in October or November. Jesse will consult with folks on Slack re: date & begin planning.
3. Eric will set up a meetup event for this organizing meeting.
4. Eric will announce the brigade planning repo on Slack and invite feedback, especially on our draft goals for the rest of the year.

The next meeting will be 8/16, probably at Pack Library - Eric will set up and confirm.

## Notes from 7/19/2016 meeting
Mostly we worked out details of the 7/20 gathering at Asheville Brewing. Other decisions/outcomes:

1. Decided to set up this brigade-planning repository. The primary purpose is to ensure that the brigade planning process is open and accessible to anyone, whether they attend meetings or not. The issues section can also serve as a place for people to raise issues or ask questions.
2. We will hold an organizing meeting every other Tuesday - the next meeting is 8/2/2016. The purpose of the meeting is general Code for Asheville planning and strategy. The meetings are open and anyone is welcome to attend, however, we won't promote or recruit people to attend. Notes from the meetings will be posted here.
3. We discussed the need for guidelines for accepting projects. Initial points are in [Project Guidelines](../projects/project-guidelines.md).

Next meeting: 5:30pm on 8/2/2016 at Twisted Laurel.
