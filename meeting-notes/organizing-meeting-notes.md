# Bi-Weekly Organizing Meeting Notes

## Notes from the 8/2/2016 meeting

TBD

## Notes from 7/19/2016 meeting
Mostly we worked out details of the 7/20 gathering at Asheville Brewing. Other decisions/outcomes:

1. Decided to set up this brigade-planning repository. The primary purpose is to ensure that the brigade planning process is open and accessible to anyone, whether they attend meetings or not. The issues section can also serve as a place for people to raise issues or ask questions.
2. We will hold an organizing meeting every other Tuesday - the next meeting is 8/2/2016. The purpose of the meeting is general Code for Asheville planning and strategy. The meetings are open and anyone is welcome to attend, however, we won't promote or recruit people to attend. Notes from the meetings will be posted here.
3. We discussed the need for guidelines for accepting projects. Initial points are in [Project Guidelines](../projects/project-guidelines.md).

Next meeting: 5:30pm on 8/2/2016 at Twisted Laurel.
