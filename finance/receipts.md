# Receipts should show:
* Name of person claiming reimbursement
* Date of charge
* Amount
* Payment backup (as opposed to an invoice copy)
** Method of payment (cash/check VISA/AMEX etc.)
** If you apply discounts such as air miles, gift cards, we will reimburse you for the net charges, after discounts
* Itemized description of products/services bought
* For restaurant receipts show both itemized receipt and CC charge slip so  we know number of individuals entertained and reasonableness of the expense
* For airline tickets. Attach email that shows the itinerary (& name, date of charge, amount)
