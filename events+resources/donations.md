# Handling Donations to Code for Asheville

Code for America administers donations for all Brigades. How it works is: folks who are interested in donating to Code for Asheville will do so through our [donate page](https://secure.codeforamerica.org/page/contribute/). Please ensure that the donor has indicated "Code for Asheville" under the last question "Is your donation for a local Brigade? If so, tell us which one". This will ensure proper allocation to your Brigade.

Once the donation has been processed the donor will receive immediate email confirmation. And in a few business days I will forward you another receipt from our accounting team.

You will submit expense reports and be reimbursed from the donation funds your Brigade has received. Expense reports must be submitted by the last day of the purchase month. Ex: if you purchased something on July 5th you must submit it by July 31st.  Reimbursement instructions are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dD1hcMO5XbiHRQfMS-3rw1PLO0H8MAoOu1p_khLGdeQ/edit).
