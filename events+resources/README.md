# Code for Asheville Brigade Events & Resources

## Current Goals

Goals for the remainder of 2016:

* Continue to seek relationships with local community groups through CfA "members"
* Finish the current round of projects (Beloved, Re-entry book)
* Identify 1-3 new projects (possibly via the EJW)
* Hackathon before end of year (possibly around EJW-Oct?)
* Identify liaisons to local development communities & begin dialogue
* Begin dialogues with City and County governments about how best

See more on the [strategic planning page](./strategic-plan.md).

## Planning Guidelines

* We want to make sure that we have some sort of event at least every other month. We can obviously do more frequently if we have reason to.
* We want to ensure that our meetings are accessible to the wider community.
  * Rotate meeting places - libraries, community centers, etc.
  * Be sensitive to issues of cost, recovery, etc.
