# Code for Asheville Brigade Events & Resources

## Planning Guidelines

* We want to make sure that we have some sort of event at least every other month. We can obviously do more frequently if we have reason to.
* We want to ensure that our meetings are accessible to the wider community.
  * Rotate meeting places - libraries, community centers, etc.
  * Be sensitive to issues of cost, recovery, etc.
