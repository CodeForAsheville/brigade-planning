# Code for Asheville Projects

As a volunteer organization, Code for Asheville recognizes that peoples' interests and availability change and so we have only a limited ability to maintain projects over the long term. Given this, our approach is to look for opportunities to partner with local community organizations and governments on focused short-term efforts with significant impact. Projects that we take on must meet our [Project Guidelines](project-guidelines.md).
