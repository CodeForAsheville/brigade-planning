# Guidelines for Code for Asheville Projects

As a volunteer organization, Code for Asheville recognizes that peoples' interests and availability change and so we have only a limited ability to maintain projects over the long term. Given this, any project CfA takes on must meet the following criteria:

* Leader - there must be an identified project lead who will drive the effort until the project is completed.
* Owner - At the end of the project, there must be an organization or person who is willing to take ownership of the results of the project going forward. They need not be capable of performing technical maintenance tasks, but must be able to handle day-to-day operations and to ask for help when need arises.
* Completion criteria - we need a way to know when the project is done and ready for handoff.
