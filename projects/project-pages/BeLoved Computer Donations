#Update 8/4/2016

I know that internet/computer access was discussed at CFA national day event and that Amy Cantrell would like to have 10 - 20 useable computers donated to BeLoved. At this point we have doanted/repaired at least 8 and still have 2 in our possession that need to be repaired/donated. You may visit their website http://www.belovedasheville.com/internet-cafe/ to read exact details on what is needed/how to help. I am aware that Calvary (location of the cafe) is undergoing rennovations, and the exact date of their completion is unknown. 

Awaiting timeline confirmation from Amy, but I've heard second hand that they're hoping to have the cafe completed before [Code Purple](https://wnchomeless.wordpress.com/2013/11/16/ashevilles-code-purple-what-does-it-really-mean/)
