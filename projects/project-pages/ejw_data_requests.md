#Economic Justice Workgroup Data Requests

Code for Asheville is working with the Economic Justice Workgroup to procure the raw data and disaggregate some of the compiled data for the following:

Per Dee Williams of the EJW:

###We need the following info:

1. The number of total persons by development, including Project 19 and scattered site housing
2. The number of elderly persons - age 62 plus years by development
3. The number of non-elderly disabled persons by development
4. The number of adults ages 18 - 61 years by development
5. The number of employed(earned income) adults age 18 -61 by development
6. The number of employed teenagers - ages 14 - 17 years - may not have but suggest they need to.
7. Household income by developments - scattered site housing
8. If HACA has racial data - Number of African Americans, Hispanics, Asian, Pacific Islanders, Natives, Whites.

If we can get raw data that they derive charts from, it would be great.

We need this information for FY 2014-2015; 2013- 2014; and FY 2012-2013 so we can spot trends.
