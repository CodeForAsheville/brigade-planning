# Re-Entry Resource Book

This is a resource that has been compiled by Christiana Tugman at the City of Asheville. Historically it has been a hard-copy binder that has been copied and provided to a couple of the prisons. However, there is great need for the resources provided by the book not only by prisoners preparing for release, but also by a wide range of people who provide services to them, including parole officers, social workers, lawyers, family members, etc.

The goal of this project is to create an online version of the re-entry resource book that can easily be:

* used by anyone with access to the web,
* printed out as a hard-copy book to provide to prisons for use by inmates planning for release
* maintained so that it is always up to date as information changes

We did an initial pass during a recent hackathon, but much remains to be done:

* Figure out a way to create a printed hardcopy of the site. Part of the challenge here is that many of the resources are actually websites and information needs to be printed from there.
* Review all the resources listed and decide how we'll present them - in many cases, this is just a link to a site where a query can be done - we may want to include both a description and instructions on use.
* Set up the basic site structure. This should follow the organization of [this presentation deck](./resources/Collateral\ Consequences\ Presentation.2015.ppt) from Pisgah Legal.
* Create all the pages.
